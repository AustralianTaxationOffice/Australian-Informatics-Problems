# Australian Informatics Utilities
This repo is a fork of Australian-Informatics-Problems.
This repo contains an updated version of aioutil, renamed to aioutil_x with a python version. A quick compiler is included too. More aio utilities will be added in the future.

cpp files are in the cpp folder, likewise with py.

## Using aioutil_x
aioutil_x will generate a folder with the .cpp (or .py) file and a in.txt and out.txt file in it.
It will keep your projects very organised and paired with the simple integrated compiler, it should make your coding easier.

For cpp users just put the binary file in your aio folder, and run it. ./aioutil_x

For python users just run the aioutil.py file. After that put the binary file in you aio folder.

## aiocompiler
For cpp users you can modify the command run in aiocompiler.cpp Put your file and folder name in aiocompiler.txt and everytime you run ./aiocompiler
it will take the fileName and folderName from there and compiler your file. Put aiocompiler.txt and aiocompiler in your aio folder to use, not your individual folder.

For python users, run compiler.py
